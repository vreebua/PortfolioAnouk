                      <p><strong>Time spent on it:</strong> 20 weeks, year 2 Master<br> 
                        <strong>Language of the project:</strong> English<br> 
                        <strong>How many people worked on it:</strong> 1<br></p>
                      <p>I had to create a data-driven application that solved an issue for my Masters graduation project. I chose to go the environmentally friendly approach and assist young individuals in correctly disposing of their plastic products, rather than littering or tossing them in the wrong container. This issue could be remedied with the help of a smart chatbot integrated into an application. The chatbot would assist the young adult in providing information about their plastic product, including what type of plastic it is and where it should be thrown according to city regulations. The chatbot would also ask the user personal questions about why they care about the environment and other related opinions on the subject. The answers provided by the user would assist the chatbot in better categorising the user, allowing it to offer a personalised gamification strategy that would help drive the user to continue properly disposing of their plastic. The categories are based on research, which state that there are six different reasons why people recycle, which are as follows: attitude, subjective norms, behavioural intent, knowledge, moral norms, and social pressure. If a user tells the chatbot that they conduct environmental acts because they have seen others do it, they will be given a gamification approach in that area. Each category can be coupled with a research-based gamification strategy. Attitude â†’ points system, subjective norms â†’ leaderbord, perceived behavioural control â†’ badges, knowledge â†’ narrative, moral norms â†’ rewards, social pressure â†’ teams. If the chatbot detects more, the user can be subjected to multiple forms of gamification. As a result, the program is constantly enhancing the user experience based on user data, thereby establishing it as a successful data-driven product. Furthermore, the application provides information about different types of plastic, how it works in their location, and opportunities to speed up the recycling process. More information on the research and overall project can be found in the papers below.</p>

                      <p>For my graduation project I had to solve an issue with a media outlet. The issue I intended to address was a student's insufficient cooking manners. I intended to decrease hasty, harmful microwave meals and encourage students to cook more healthfully. After settling on the challenge, there was a lot of idea generation, research, feedback, and testing to come up with a cohesive concept and design. Finally, the application focuses on inspiring the student through gamification. Simply put, the app provides cooking tasks, a choice of recipes ranging from simple and quick to tough and time-consuming, displays progression in a variety of ways, badges can be earned, friends may assist and join the adventure, and a grocery list can be established.</p>

                      <p>For the machine learning lesson, I intended to create music using Artificial Intelligence and the RNN-LSTM model. This project is separated into four steps: data collection, data cleaning, model construction, and model evaluation. I wanted to create jazz music, namely a jazz sheet. To begin, I acquired a significant number of jazz songs. In the second phase, data cleansing, I compared jazz songs based on parameters including tempo, number of measures, style, and density. I trimmed my jazz music dataset by only including jazz songs that matched in all of these categories, so that the model might have a higher success rate later on. This model is known as RNN-LSTM. This model can predict the next note in a melody. Reading comparable jazz songs allows it to guess what note will be played next, resulting in a new note at the end. By repeating this procedure, a whole new melody can be created, and therefore a song can be formed. I recommend reading this more clearly in myÂ GitHubÂ ipnyb files, as they cover the entire procedure in detail, including preprocessing, encoding, sequence creation, mapping, converting, training, layering, and producing.</p>

                      <p>My first exposure to Artificial Intelligence was through my project AI Movie Recommender. The assignment's primary goal was to learn as much as possible about this emerging technology, but with the end goal of creating a product. After learning about the technology and brainstorming ideas, the end result is a website (without visuals) that assists the user in selecting a Netflix movie or show based on their most recent Twitter posts. The AI was able to read Twitter posts and determine from the text what kind of emotion the user was feeling and what the subject of their post was about, with the help of Google Natural Language and a Twitter API. "I am excited about this wedding," for example, would tell the AI that "excited" is a positive word and "wedding" is a subject. Following that, the AI scans the Netflix database for movies or series, as well as the tags they provide, that can be related to the discovered emotions and words, in order to recommend them.</p>

                      <p>For this project, we needed to collaborate in order to elevate an established organization using emerging technologies. Our company was NPO, and our emerging technologies were recommender systems and NFTs. After conversing with NPO themselves, we learnt about the NPO's beliefs, key goals, and target group distinctions. We were able to hypothetically design and immerse emerging technologies within their NPO system, targeting some of their weaker target audiences for increased engagement while still enforcing all of their ideals, as well as their design principles. Both technologies were integrated into their NPO Start application.</p>

                      <p>A three-week timeframe was set for this project, with the purpose of swiftly understanding a new developing technology and how it can solve a problem. My chosen technology was the Internet of Things (IoT), which I worked with in the Arduino Program using an Arduino board. The issue I chose is known as the front doorway effect. When someone walks out the front door, a psychological event known as the doorway effect might occur, causing them to forget why they walked through the door or if they took all of their possessions with them. Multiple sensors were employed with the help of IoT to read data and to help alarm and remind the user of their items when going outside. Detecting data movement at the front door, providing visual and audio reminders to the user, and buttons to overcome hurdles whether the front door is used for other purposes are all possible.</p>

                      <p>This project was given a short time frame of three weeks. This assignment's goal was to learn how to quickly master a new upcoming technology. Following some brainstorming, the idea was born that malware could be detected on a mobile phone using the Internet of Things (IoT). If a mobile phone becomes infected with malware, it may exhibit a variety of symptoms, including high temperature. I thought I'd connect the two because IoT is known for its ability to identify certain sensors and immediately communicate that data. As a result, I used an application to set up a connection between an old mobile phone and my Arduino board. This connection was constantly reading and reporting the temperature of the phone. The phone had become infected with malware. If the Arduino board detects strange sparks of higher temperature inside the phone, it will alert the user using other IoT products that can communicate via sound and visual.</p>

                      <p>DataSee is an Augmented Reality (AR) application that helps enhance young adults' awareness about how much personal data they spend on their apps and how harmful that might be. It is able to show their data back in a fun, engaging, and interactive way by collecting their screen time data on a daily basis. After permitting the program to collect screen time data, the user will see their own application use reflected back to them in the form of data blobs, which can alter from day to day. Furthermore, each application data blob is a different colour, suggesting to the user whether or not this application is secure to disclose personal data on, or if it is easy subject to hacker assaults. The program expands on this theme by include components such as what would happen to their data if a hacker attacked the application, questions and quizzes about online safety, and more in-depth information about each application and how to be more secure with their data.</p>

                      <p>This game was created in a team of five during the minor Applied Game Design. Everyone on our team had a specific role, with mine being the lead game designer and side programmer. The game's intended audience is pupils aged twelve and up who are visiting a history museum. The goal of this game is to collect as much as you can in a limited amount of time to progress a story. In level 1, for example, you visit a castle as a 3D knight and must acquire items such as swords, horses, rope and wheels. That is, if you can find all of them. When the timer runs out, the user can utilise the collected things to build a tale. The more items you collect, the more likely it is that you will be able to create a compelling story. For example, "the knight must combat a bear; what weapon do they use?" If a sword was collected, it might be utilised to change the course of the story. There are three levels in total, and the plot progresses with each level. The narrative of the story is set in medieval times, allowing the target audience to learn about history in a fascinating way. You triumph when you successfully complete the story. If you collect too few objects, critical steps in the game may be skipped or answered wrong, preventing you from reaching the finish and forcing you to restart.</p>

This was my first time coding in Unity for a game. The game's purpose is to free the princess by defeating the villains in each coloured chamber. There are three different colours: blue, red, and green. Each colour contains numerous rooms and a wide range of opponents, from sword strikes to archers. A key is located at the end of each chamber. When all three keys are collected, the door to the princess unlocks.</p>

                      <p>This board game was created in a four-person team during the minor Applied Game Design. We just had one week to develop a concept, produce the game and explanatory book, and film a product video. Our board game is a spin-off of the popular game Bomberman. With our board game, the participants are not bombers, but rather legendary movie killers such as Jason Voorhees and Michael Meyers. The purpose of the game is to be the last one standing, which you can do by slicing other players, constructing traps, or using their unique powers. A dice determines which move you can make and how far you can go.</p>

                      <p>This was my first exposure to Virtual Reality (VR). While studying, it was discovered that people can have motion sickness from VR if they are quickly put into a new fantasy-like environment. To address this issue, I created a recognised safe space for when you first enter VR to make the transition from real time to VR easier. They can adjust their eyes to the VR experience before entering the fantasy world this way. I was able to accomplish this using Unity and Blender.</p>

                      <p>From the end of August 2020 to the beginning of February 2021, I worked as a UX designer at Notice Branded Media, a marketing agency. During my internship, I worked on a variety of UX designer jobs, including revamping a TOI website and coming up with new creative ideas, 1 and 2. My major task, though, was to improve the user experience of their present product, the Company Locator. The Company Locator is a self-contained interactive structure located near the entrance to buildings that provide a variety of company spaces. It allows users to sign in for appointments and tells them how to navigate the building to get to them. My objective was to rethink the interface and recreate the map images. To complete this task, extensive study on what would work best for the target audience and how to best achieve the aim was required. Following that, several concepts emerged, input was gathered, and effective tests were conducted in order to create a proud product in the end.</p>

                      <p>For the class smart interfaces, an application to assist a more vulnerable target group in their daily lives was to be created. We opted to target folks with low literacy levels. People who are illiterate struggle with reading, writing, and other arithmetic. It was difficult to create a helpful application for this target demographic because there were so many details to consider. A well-designed learning language application was created by conducting study on how to best approach material to the group, discussing with the group, and testing. This program assists low literacy individuals in learning to write and read through lessons and customisable categories. Furthermore, the program can be tailored to the user's lifestyle and language difficulties, since the user can utilise a camera and microphone feature to ask the application what words around them in real life mean, such as when reading an important letter.</p>

                      <p>From March to June of 2019, I worked as a designer intern at Tapperuse, an app that lets you to go on exciting trips and only pay for the time you are there, as well as information about the location. During my internship, I primarily concentrated on visual research, visual design, coming up with and assisting with UX design concepts, and maintaining their Wordpress website. With this in mind, consider the following examples: I created advertisements for their application, explanation screens for how the application works, animations for within the application, and sketches for future ideas.</p>

                      <p>This assignment required me to develop a visual for a chosen story. The narrative I chose, "Klumperbeven," is a difficult and convoluted read, with the words linked in strange ways and distributed incoherently throughout. I attempted to demonstrate that effect with these graphics.</p>

                      <p>The goal of this school assignment was to learn from a certain company's visuals and how they might be expanded. MELKWEG, a prominent music venue, was my company. MELKWEG is well-known for its bold, straight typefaces and vibrant colours. In a variant MELKWEG style, I created an agenda poster listing which concerts would be held, as well as two music posters combining MELKWEG style with the musicians themselves.</p>

                      <p>From the end of August 2020 to the beginning of February 2021, I worked as a UX designer at Notice Branded Media, a marketing agency. Because they are a marketing agency, many video design requests were received in addition to UX design. I worked from the conception of the video and animation concept to its realisation on an Adobe platform. These would be designed for companies such as DA, Wibra, Kippie, KFC, Gamemania, BP, and others to display in their stores.</p>
