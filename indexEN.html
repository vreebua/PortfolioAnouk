                      <p>For my graduation project, I created a data-driven application that helps young people dispose of their plastic products properly. This was solved by a smart chatbot that provides information about the type of plastic and where it should be disposed of according to city regulations. The chatbot also asks personal questions about why the user cares about the environment and other related opinions. The user's answers help the chatbot to offer a personalized gamification strategy to help the user properly dispose of their plastic. This program uses six different reasons why people recycle, including attitude, subjective norms, behavioral intention, knowledge, moral norms and social pressure. Each category is linked to a research-based gamification strategy. If the chatbot detects more, the user can be subjected to multiple forms of gamification.</p>

                      <p>For my graduation project I had to solve an issue with a media outlet. The issue I intended to address was a student's insufficient cooking manners. I intended to decrease hasty, harmful microwave meals and encourage students to cook more healthfully. After settling on the challenge, there was a lot of idea generation, research, feedback, and testing to come up with a cohesive concept and design. Finally, the application focuses on inspiring the student through gamification. Simply put, the app provides cooking tasks, a choice of recipes ranging from simple and quick to tough and time-consuming, displays progression in a variety of ways, badges can be earned, friends may assist and join the adventure, and a grocery list can be established.</p>

                      <p>For the machine learning lesson, I intended to create music using Artificial Intelligence and the RNN-LSTM model. This project is separated into four steps: data collection, data cleaning, model construction, and model evaluation. I wanted to create jazz music, namely a jazz sheet. To begin, I acquired a significant number of jazz songs. In the second phase, data cleansing, I compared jazz songs based on parameters including tempo, number of measures, style, and density. I trimmed my jazz music dataset by only including jazz songs that matched in all of these categories, so that the model might have a higher success rate later on. This model is known as RNN-LSTM. This model can predict the next note in a melody. Reading comparable jazz songs allows it to guess what note will be played next, resulting in a new note at the end. By repeating this procedure, a whole new melody can be created, and therefore a song can be formed. I recommend reading this more clearly in my GitHub ipnyb files, as they cover the entire procedure in detail, including preprocessing, encoding, sequence creation, mapping, converting, training, layering, and producing.</p>

                      <p>My first exposure to Artificial Intelligence was through my project AI Movie Recommender. The assignment's primary goal was to learn as much as possible about this emerging technology, but with the end goal of creating a product. After learning about the technology and brainstorming ideas, the end result is a website (without visuals) that assists the user in selecting a Netflix movie or show based on their most recent Twitter posts. The AI was able to read Twitter posts and determine from the text what kind of emotion the user was feeling and what the subject of their post was about, with the help of Google Natural Language and a Twitter API. "I am excited about this wedding," for example, would tell the AI that "excited" is a positive word and "wedding" is a subject. Following that, the AI scans the Netflix database for movies or series, as well as the tags they provide, that can be related to the discovered emotions and words, in order to recommend them.</p>

                      <p>A three-week timeframe was set for this project, with the purpose of swiftly understanding a new developing technology and how it can solve a problem. My chosen technology was the Internet of Things (IoT), which I worked with in the Arduino Program using an Arduino board. The issue I chose is known as the front doorway effect. When someone walks out the front door, a psychological event known as the doorway effect might occur, causing them to forget why they walked through the door or if they took all of their possessions with them. Multiple sensors were employed with the help of IoT to read data and to help alarm and remind the user of their items when going outside. Detecting data movement at the front door, providing visual and audio reminders to the user, and buttons to overcome hurdles whether the front door is used for other purposes are all possible.</p>

                      <p>This project was given a short time frame of three weeks. This assignment's goal was to learn how to quickly master a new upcoming technology. Following some brainstorming, the idea was born that malware could be detected on a mobile phone using the Internet of Things (IoT). If a mobile phone becomes infected with malware, it may exhibit a variety of symptoms, including high temperature. I thought I'd connect the two because IoT is known for its ability to identify certain sensors and immediately communicate that data. As a result, I used an application to set up a connection between an old mobile phone and my Arduino board. This connection was constantly reading and reporting the temperature of the phone. The phone had become infected with malware. If the Arduino board detects strange sparks of higher temperature inside the phone, it will alert the user using other IoT products that can communicate via sound and visual.</p>

                      <p>This game was created in a team of five during the minor Applied Game Design. This game is designed for students from the age of twelve who visit a historical museum. The aim of this game is to collect as much as possible in a limited time to advance a story. There are three levels in total, and the plot progresses with each level. The storyline of the story is set in the Middle Ages, allowing the target audience to get acquainted with the history in an exciting way.</p>

                      <p>This game was created in a team of four during the minor Applied Game Design. Everyone on our team had a specific position, with mine being the developer. This was my first time coding in Unity for a game. The game's purpose is to free the princess by defeating the villains in each coloured chamber. There are three different colours: blue, red, and green. Each colour contains numerous rooms and a wide range of opponents, from sword strikes to archers. A key is located at the end of each chamber. When all three keys are collected, the door to the princess unlocks.</p>

                      <p>In a free project I decided to learn more about the C# language and make a maze generator. I chose a depth-first algorithm. With this algorithm, you start at a random point and keep digging paths in one of 4 directions (up, right, down, left) until you can't go any further. If stuck, the maze moves back one step until it finds another open path. This keeps repeating until the maze is finished. In addition to the algorithm, it is also interactive with a menu screen. In this menu screen the user can choose and adjust the length and width of the maze and see how the maze is built. Also, the user can decide in the menu if they want to walk in it after the maze is built. If so, the camera is changed to a first person view and you can walk with the "wasd" keys and rotate with the mouse.</p>

                      <p>This board game was created in a four-person team during the minor Applied Game Design. We just had one week to develop a concept, produce the game and explanatory book, and film a product video. Our board game is a spin-off of the popular game Bomberman. With our board game, the participants are not bombers, but rather legendary movie killers such as Jason Voorhees and Michael Meyers. The purpose of the game is to be the last one standing, which you can do by slicing other players, constructing traps, or using their unique powers. A dice determines which move you can make and how far you can go.</p>

                      <p>This was my first exposure to Virtual Reality (VR). While studying, it was discovered that people can have motion sickness from VR if they are quickly put into a new fantasy-like environment. To address this issue, I created a recognised safe space for when you first enter VR to make the transition from real time to VR easier. They can adjust their eyes to the VR experience before entering the fantasy world this way. I was able to accomplish this using Unity and Blender.</p>

                      <p>As a UX designer at Notice Branded Media I worked on improving the user experience of their current product, the Company Locator. This project involved reimagining the interface and map views. Accomplishing this task required an extensive study of what would work best for the target audience and how best to achieve the goal. Subsequently, different concepts were created, input was collected and effective tests were carried out.</p>

                      <p>For this project, we needed to collaborate in order to elevate an established organization using emerging technologies. Our company was NPO, and our emerging technologies were recommender systems and NFTs. After conversing with NPO themselves, we learnt about the NPO's beliefs, key goals, and target group distinctions. We were able to hypothetically design and immerse emerging technologies within their NPO system, targeting some of their weaker target audiences for increased engagement while still enforcing all of their ideals, as well as their design principles. Both technologies were integrated into their NPO Start application.</p>

                      <p>For the smart interfaces class I made an application to help low literate people in their daily lives. This program helps low literate people learn to write and read through lessons and customizable categories. In addition, the program can be adapted to the user's lifestyle and language difficulties, as the user can make use of a camera and microphone function to ask the application what words around them mean in real life.</p>

                      <p>From March to June of 2019, I worked as a designer intern at Tapperuse, an app that lets you to go on exciting trips and only pay for the time you are there, as well as information about the location. During my internship, I primarily concentrated on visual research, visual design, coming up with and assisting with UX design concepts, and maintaining their Wordpress website. With this in mind, consider the following examples: I created advertisements for their application, explanation screens for how the application works, animations for within the application, and sketches for future ideas.</p>

                      <p>This assignment required me to develop a visual for a chosen story. The narrative I chose, "Klumperbeven," is a difficult and convoluted read, with the words linked in strange ways and distributed incoherently throughout. I attempted to demonstrate that effect with these graphics.</p>

                      <p>The goal of this school assignment was to learn from a certain company's visuals and how they might be expanded. MELKWEG, a prominent music venue, was my company. MELKWEG is well-known for its bold, straight typefaces and vibrant colours. In a variant MELKWEG style, I created an agenda poster listing which concerts would be held, as well as two music posters combining MELKWEG style with the musicians themselves.</p>

                      <p>From the end of August 2020 to the beginning of February 2021, I worked as a UX designer at Notice Branded Media, a marketing agency. Because they are a marketing agency, many video design requests were received in addition to UX design. I worked from the conception of the video and animation concept to its realisation on an Adobe platform. These would be designed for companies such as DA, Wibra, Kippie, KFC, Gamemania, BP, and others to display in their stores.</p>
